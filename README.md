- 👋 Hi, I’m @VanguardLLC
- I’m interested in learning some of the why's and how's of the modern world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through the Odin project; and just a side of freelance Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 I can be reached through GitHub for any and all questions, comments, concerns.

And that's the basic nonsense out of the way; the rest of the story is a small novel. I'm an electrician by trade, with this delusion
of becoming an electrical engineer... before I even got started down that path, I was introduced to the simplicity and capability of Python.
Being the practical modern human, and not having $120,000 to drop into an envelope labeled "Master's Degree", I've been poking around on the 
Odin project. Like so many before, the monumental amount of options are awe inspiring.
